# configfiles
This repo contains .gitconfig and Microsoft.Powershell_profile.ps1 so that I (or anyone who is interested) can easily update my gitconfig and powershell profile if I am working on a machine that I usually don't work on.

Note on .gitconfig: It DOES NOT have the user and email so you would need to add it manually.
